ABSTRACT:

Since 2003, Quito, the Capital of Ecuador, has implemented an air quality monitoring system that records hourly urban background concentrations of CO, NOx, NO2, O3, PM2.5, PM10 and SO2, as well as meteorological data. However, currently no modelling system for forecasting or estimating hourly concentrations of air pollution at background level for Quito has been implemented. This study evaluates the application of the UBM model, developed by Aarhus University, for calculating pollutant levels at the location of six monitoring stations. Air pollution is estimated based on emissions inventories, regional background and meteorological data for year 2009. Emissions are scaled, using calibration factors, to ensure computed concentrations fit with observed values based on the analysis of emissions inventories produced in Quito and other cities in Latin-American. Output values from the UBM model are graphically and statistically evaluated against measurements. Results show that, for Quito, the UBM model successfully estimates the hourly concentrations for CO, NO2, NOx, O3 and PM2.5. These findings confirm the applicability of UBM to model air pollution at urban background level in Quito. Best performance of UBM is achieved when using meteorological data retrieved from the corresponding location of simulation, although satisfactory results are obtained when the modelling for all locations is conducted applying meteorological data derived from only one location. Applying emissions and calibration factors from year 2009 with corresponding meteorology data from 2008 and 2010, the UBM model shows similar performance as for the year 2009. Unsatisfactory results for estimating SO2 concentrations suggest that the emissions data must be revised.
